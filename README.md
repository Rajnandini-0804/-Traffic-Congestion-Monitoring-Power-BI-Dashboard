📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and monitoring road traffic congestion using cleaned traffic data and an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal is to identify congestion patterns, peak hours, high-delay locations, and support data-driven traffic management decisions.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python – Pandas)

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Python.
Key steps include:

Handling missing and null values

Removing duplicates

Standardizing column names

Data type conversions (date, time, numeric fields)

Creating derived columns for analysis (e.g., peak time, congestion level)

📌 The cleaned dataset was then used for visualization in Power BI.

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Traffic volume analysis

Congestion level comparison

Peak vs non-peak hour insights

Delay patterns across locations

Key KPIs for quick decision-making


## 📌 Visuals Included in Dashboard

- Vehicle Count by Location & Congestion Level  
- Traffic Speed Categories (High, Medium, Low)
- Vehicle Type vs Speed (Bike, Car, Scooty, etc.)
- Traffic Congestion Map (Location Wise)
- Speed Distribution Pie Chart

📈 Key KPIs Used

Average Traffic Speed

Congestion Index

Delay Duration

Peak Hour Traffic Count

High Congestion Zones
